## Hello! 

My name is Shawn. I'm a CS grad looking for a job. Right now I work as a tutor at Brooklyn College, helping impressionable young people realize that they have the potential to be great engineers. My main interests are C++ and compilers, but I dabble in Python as well. Java is my 'mother tongue', and the language I am most familiar with. It is what I LeetCode in! I use Neovim, btw.

Here's what I've been working on:

<ul>
<li>Socks (🧦), an application to allow my fellow tutors to auto-generate their time-sheets</li>
<li>maple 🥞, my biggest toy project, a learning platform for Brooklyn College computer science students. View it here - https://cisc-1115.vercel.app/</li>
<li>a C++ compiler for the toy language 'Kaleidoscope'</li>
<li>waffles 🧇, a 2D game written in Python</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"> These are the technologies I use: </p>
