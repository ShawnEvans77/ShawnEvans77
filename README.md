## Hello! 

My name is Shawn. I'm a CS grad looking for a job. Right now I work as a tutor at Brooklyn College, helping impressionable young people realize that they have the potential to be great engineers. My main interests are C++ and compilers, but I dabble in Python as well. Java is my 'mother tongue', and the language I am most familiar with. It is what I LeetCode in! I use Neovimim, by the way.

Check out my projects! I'm working on Socks (🧦), an application to allow my fellow tutors to auto-generate their time-sheets. I'm studying compilers, you can view that in the 'Kaleidoscope Compiler' directory. I am making a cute game using Python, currently I am going to give it a physics engine.
