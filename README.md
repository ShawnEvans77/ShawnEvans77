## Hello! 

Hi, I'm a CS grad looking for a job. Right now I work as a tutor at Brooklyn College. I help young adults realize that they have the potential to be great engineers. My main interests are C++ and compilers, but I've been working with Python recently. Java is my 'mother tongue'. I use Neovim, btw.

Here's what I've been working on:

<ul>
<li>marnie bot, a pokemon python discord bot replicating pokemon showdown's !dt command</li>
<li>socks, an application to allow my fellow tutors to auto-generate their time-sheets</li>
<li>maple, a website made so students at my college don't need to take pictures of messy chalkboards for notes
</ul>

There are other random toy repositories here, like a Brainfudge intepreter I wrote in Python. The main stuff is in my pinned, but you will see some fascinating stuff in my repositories.
