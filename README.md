## Hello! 

Hi, I'm a CS grad looking for a job. Right now I work as a tutor at Brooklyn College, helping young adults realize that they have the potential to be great engineers. My main interests are C++ and compilers, but I dabble in Python as well. Java is my 'mother tongue', and the language I am most familiar with. It is what I LeetCode in! I use Neovim, btw.

Here's what I've been working on:

<ul>
<li>marnie bot (👢), a pokemon discord bot using restAPIs and python</li>
<li>Socks (🧦), an application to allow my fellow tutors to auto-generate their time-sheets</li>
<li>maple 🥞, my biggest toy project, a learning platform for Brooklyn College computer science students. 
<li>waffles 🧇, a 2D game written in Python</li>
</ul>

There are other random toy repositories here, like a Brainfudge intepreter I wrote in Python. The main stuff is in my pinned, but you will see some fascinating stuff in my repositories.
